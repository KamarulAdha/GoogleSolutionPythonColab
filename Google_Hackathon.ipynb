And like it or not, if you’re a human, so are you. Alas, I digress). The step says to start small, using a chisel or somethings slightly less blatant than a sledgehammer. As impatient and reluctant as I am to wait and take time, I think I finally understand I need to. I need to start small, appreciate little changes and tiny bits of progress because it’s not just going to be served to me on a silver platter.

Yes there are similarities between the two, but there are some vital differences. And I do have to implore you to take my advice when I say the sledgehammer technique DOES NOT WORK. The reason being, you never know what’s in that wall, you never know whether someone’s planted a bomb in there to spite you, or if there’s a water pipe ready to burst as soon as some knobhead comes along with a sledgehammer and cracks it open. You have to approach the entire wall slowly and carefully because, like the wall, you may seem very sturdy and stable on the outside, but the reality is you are so incredibly delicate and intricately designed, that anymore than a chisel may bring you crashing back down to ground zero.

During these hallucinations I'm like kinda half asleep and I'll take them as real but as I've gotten older I've gotten a little about rationalizing even in my sleep that what I'm seeing isn't real. I have anxiety and some past trauma in a way that it makes sense to me these hallucinations manifest this way.  \n",

My building recently put up scaffolding for repairs. I live on the 14th floor. A few weeks ago, as I was in an early sleep stage, I suddenly shoot up in bed gasping in surprise. I don't exactly know what startled me, but then outside of my window there appeared to be a silhouette of a man standing on the scaffolding projected on my curtain. I sit there for a minute trying to decide what to do, and then I decide I should take a picture to show management in the morning. But when I go for my phone, it lights up and I don't want him to see and scare him off before I can really understand what's going on.   \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "So then I decide to just go peak out my curtain, but when I look I can't see anything around. When I step back, the silhouette is still there. I feel awake but confused, but eventually decide it's just the way the curtain is laying or something. I fall back to sleep, and then --I don't know, 20 minutes later -- I'm startled awake again by I don't know what, and the silhouette is gone. \n",
            "\n",
            "Then again a few nights ago, I'm in early sleep when I'm startled awake by something, and I see a silhouette of a person on the lower scaffolding peering into my window. I sit there for longer this time, really trying to make sure I feel awake and I am actually seeing what I'm seeing. I watch to see if the figure moves and it doesn't. I go to peer out my curtain and don't see anything, but when I step back the silhouette is gone.   \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "I was explaining this as a funny story to my friend who is a psych nurse, and she briefly brought up the possibility that it could be schizophrenia but I wasn't having any other symptoms and I was pretty aware of the situation so she didn't think that was likely. But it still has gotten me wondering...\n",

            "&amp;#x200B;\n",
            "\n",
            "I've been trying to figure out what it was; either people are actually scaling the scaffolding to the 14th floor just so they can be creeps or my apartment is haunted. Or I wasn't actually as awake as I thought I was but truly, I still really, really felt like I was awake.   \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm just curious what it actually feels like to have schizophrenic hallucinations, especially visual ones? I will add that I've always been an anxious person, with maybe mild paranoia. But since moving to the city I know I've gotten much more paranoid. Things like, I'll see someone on the train platform that has a weird vibe and I'll be so freaked out by them I won't get on the train with them or actively get off the train before my actual stop. \n",
            "\n",
            "I don't know if that means anything or if all of this basically amounts to I'm just an anxious person and my sleep isn't the quality it should be.\n",
